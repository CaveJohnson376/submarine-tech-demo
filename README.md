# QnA
- wow cool, but add this
> no. i consider this project to be finished, and i will add nothing more to it. though, you can fork it and use as base for something bigger :ะช
- there's a bug!
> well, if you've managed to break my game, why not to join me in efforts of breaking my future games? *more info on my website, check my profile :D*
- if it's a tech demo, what you plan to do with it?
> i'm gonna use tech used in this demo for my future projects. spoiler alert, it's not about underwater, but rather, *above*water, and maybe even space. the tech is really simple but i needed to mess around with it to get hang of it
- wait-wait-wait-wait, 3.5 hours and challenged by JohnTheCoolingFan?
> yeah he literally challenged me to make "a short prototype/tech demo game about submarine, where you can walk inside submarine and submarine itself can move too. i don't think i can do this, but can you?". i accepted the challenge and made this.
